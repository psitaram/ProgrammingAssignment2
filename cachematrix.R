## These functions cache the inverse of a matrix so that it doesn't need to be computed repeatedly

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m<- NULL
  set<- function(y){
    x<<-y
    m<<- NULL
  }
  get<-function() x
  setsolve<-function(solve) m<<- solve
  getsolve<-function() m
  list(set=set, get=get,
       setsolve=setsolve,
       getsolve=getsolve)

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by the function above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed) then this function should retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m<-x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(m)){
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data<-x$get()
  m<-solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(m)
  m
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
